functionsCalc.py is a simple calculator that works with functions inside the code 
how to use----> just change the given numbers by print inside the code to whatever you like every function does a different thing.

terminal_calc.py is a simple calculator written by me to calculate different values, it has a menu from wich you can choose what you wanna calc,
as well as an exit you can choose in the menu wich exits the proramm.
how to use ----> just look at what you wanna calculate with the tool enter the numbers and done, pretty simple :)
to execute the file on windows and also linux just go to the folder where the file is stored and open the terminal in there an then type in python 
(followed by the name of the programm) if you get an error message like that windows doesnt know the command you first need to install python via the official website
